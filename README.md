# ASP.NET Core Minimal API Training

This is my code for the [Create web apps and services with ASP.NET Core, minimal API, and .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/aspnet-core-minimal-api/) training.

It uses [ASP.NET Core Minimal API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview) with [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

## Building

To build the project, just run the `dotnet build` command.

## Running

After building the project, run `dotnet run` on your terminal.

Then open `http://localhost:{PORT}/swagger` on your browser to inspect the API.

> The `{PORT}` is generated by the `dotnet` tool, so check the port used on your terminal.
